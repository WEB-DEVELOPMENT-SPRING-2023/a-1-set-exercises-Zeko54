        <h4>Best Tarantino movie and you can't change my mind</h4>
        <p>
          Jango (D is silence) is just one of those movie you can watch every
          year and it never gets old. It's also the origin of those Di Caprio
          memes you saw online, so you know is good. Also Christoph Waltz stole
          the show here and made me discover all other his movies.
        </p>

        <h4>Tarantino is undefeated</h4>
        <p>
          This is a movie that wouldn't work with every other director other
          than Tarantino. Just like all of his movies, film making top tier.
          Every aspect of this film is amazing
        </p>

        <h4>Unmistakable Tarantino</h4>
        <p>
          Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his
          next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all
          wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on
          a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a
          notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br />
          <br />This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as
          unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another.
          It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the
          subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's
          the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood
          ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just
          finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great
          film.
        </p>

        <h4>A masterpiece!</h4>
        <p>
          Django Unchained is a 2012 Hollywood movie depicting the story of a
          former slave turned freeman who just wants to get his wife back. He
          will stop at nothing to unite with his wife. A brilliant masterpiece
          of a movie. The gut-wrenching way in which slavery in past-America is
          depicted is simply awe-inspiring. Quentin Tarantino goes all out to
          show the viewers what slavery was like in those days.<br />
          <br />Every character in the movie were aptly cast and put on a
          splendid show. Every scene with Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz is
          memorable and impressionable. All in all, this is a Tarantino movie.
          So, you gotta watch it. A revenge story so good that it will stir up
          your insides!
