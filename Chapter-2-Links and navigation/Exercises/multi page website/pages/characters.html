        <h4>Django</h4>
        <p>
          Django played by Jamie Foxx is the main character of the film and a
          former slave who has been freed by Dr. King Schultz. Django is
          determined to rescue his wife from slavery, and is willing to do
          whatever it takes to get her back. Throughout the film, Django
          transforms from a vulnerable and timid man into a confident and
          skilled bounty hunter.
        </p>

        <h4>Dr. King Schultz</h4>
        <p>
          Dr. King Schultz played by Christopher Waltz is a German dentist
          turned bounty hunter who takes Django under his wing and trains him in
          the art of hunting outlaws. Schultz is a charming and sophisticated
          man who uses his wit and intelligence to get what he wants. Despite
          his ruthless nature, he is also shown to have a sense of justice and a
          strong moral code.
        </p>

        <h4>Calvin Candie</h4>
        <p>
          Calvin Candie played by Leonardo Di DiCaprio is the main antagonist of
          the film and the owner of the plantation where Django's wife is being
          held. Candie is a cruel and sadistic man who takes pleasure in causing
          others to suffer. He is also depicted as being intelligent and
          cunning, and he is able to maintain control over his plantation
          through fear and intimidation.
