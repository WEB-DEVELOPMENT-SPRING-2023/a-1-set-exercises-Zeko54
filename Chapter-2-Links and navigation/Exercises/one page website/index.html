          Django Unchained is set in the South two years before the Civil War.
          The film opens with Django, a slave who is being transported with
          several other slaves. They are eventually rescued by Dr. King Schultz,
          a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter who needs Django's help in
          identifying three fugitives he is tracking. In exchange for Django's
          assistance, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue his wife,
          Broomhilda, who has been sold to a different plantation. Django and
          Schultz form a partnership and embark on a journey to track down the
          fugitives and gather information about Broomhilda's whereabouts.<br />
          <br />Along the way, they encounter various characters, including
          plantation owners, slaves, and other bounty hunters. Schultz also
          teaches Django how to become a bounty hunter himself, and the two
          develop a close friendship. Eventually, they discover that Broomhilda
          is held captive at a plantation called "Candyland," owned by the
          charismatic and sadistic Calvin Candie. Django and Schultz devise a
          plan to rescue Broomhilda, posing as buyers interested in purchasing
          one of Candie's "mandingo fighters," enslaved black men forced to
          fight to the death for entertainment. At Candyland, Django and Schultz
          meet Candie and his loyal house slave Stephen, who becomes suspicious
          of the two men and their motives.<br />
          <br />Despite this, Candie agrees to show them the mandingo fighting
          and eventually reveals that Broomhilda is his property. A tense
          standoff ensues, and Django and Schultz are forced to fight for their
          lives against Candie and his henchmen. The two men use their wit and
          skills to outwit their opponents and successfully rescue Broomhilda.
          They then make their escape, pursued by Candie's men. The film ends
          with Django and Broomhilda riding off into the sunset, having achieved
          their goal and exacted revenge against those who had wronged
          them.Throughout the film, themes of slavery, racism, and revenge are
          explored, and the characters are forced to confront the brutal
          realities of the pre-Civil War South. The film's stunning
          cinematography, gripping action sequences, and powerful performances
          from the cast make it a memorable and thought-provoking work of art.

        <h4>Best Tarantino movie and you can't change my mind</h4>
        <p>
          Jango (D is silence) is just one of those movie you can watch every
          year and it never gets old. It's also the origin of those Di Caprio
          memes you saw online, so you know is good. Also Christoph Waltz stole
          the show here and made me discover all other his movies.
        </p>

        <h4>Tarantino is undefeated</h4>
        <p>
          This is a movie that wouldn't work with every other director other
          than Tarantino. Just like all of his movies, film making top tier.
          Every aspect of this film is amazing
        </p>

        <h4>Unmistakable Tarantino</h4>
        <p>
          Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his
          next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all
          wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on
          a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a
          notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br />
          <br />This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as
          unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another.
          It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the
          subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's
          the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood
          ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just
          finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great
          film.
        </p>

        <h4>A masterpiece!</h4>
        <p>
          Django Unchained is a 2012 Hollywood movie depicting the story of a
          former slave turned freeman who just wants to get his wife back. He
          will stop at nothing to unite with his wife. A brilliant masterpiece
          of a movie. The gut-wrenching way in which slavery in past-America is
          depicted is simply awe-inspiring. Quentin Tarantino goes all out to
          show the viewers what slavery was like in those days.<br />
          <br />Every character in the movie were aptly cast and put on a
          splendid show. Every scene with Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz is
          memorable and impressionable. All in all, this is a Tarantino movie.
          So, you gotta watch it. A revenge story so good that it will stir up
          your insides!
