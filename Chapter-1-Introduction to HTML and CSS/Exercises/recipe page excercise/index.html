        Haleem is a popular dish in Pakistan. Haleem is made with mutton,
        lentils, and wheat. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that is often
        enjoyed during the winter months.<br />
        Haleem is also a high calorie dish which gives instant energy as it
        contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients.

      <ol>
        <!-- The ol tag defines an ordered list, which is a list of items in a specific order. -->
        <li>
          Soak the broken wheat and lentils (urad dal, yellow moong dal, chana
          dal, and toor dal) separately for at least 2 hours.
        </li>
        <br />
        <!--creates a line break in the text. -->
        <li>
          Cooking the Mutton and Lentil Mixture. In a large pot, add the mutton,
          soaked lentils (drained), ginger paste, garlic paste,
          <br />red chilli powder, turmeric, salt, and enough water to cover
          everything.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cook over medium heat until the mutton is tender and falling apart,
          and the lentils have turned into a paste-like consistency,<br />
          stirring occasionally. This may take around 2-3 hours.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Shredding the Mutton Remove the mutton from the pot and shred it with
          a fork or chop it finely. Keep it aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Frying the Onions In a pan, heat ghee and fry the onions until they
          turn golden brown.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Adding the Shredded Mutton Add the shredded mutton, garam masala, and
          pepper to the pan with the fried onions.<br />
          Fry for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Combining the Mutton and Lentil Mixture Add the cooked lentil mixture
          to the pan with the mutton and stir well.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Adding the Broken Wheat and Other Ingredients. Add the soaked broken
          wheat to the pan along with 6-8 cups of water,<br />
          or enough to cover everything. Stir well.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the green chillies, cashews, and mint to the pan. Mix everything
          well and let it simmer for 1-2 hours over low heat,<br />
          stirring occasionally, until the haleem reaches a porridge-like
          consistency.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Serving the Haleem Serve hot, garnished with chopped coriander leaves
          and more fried onions, if desired.
